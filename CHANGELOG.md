## v0.1.0

Initial release.

Features:

- Ability to load Tracee JSON output files into Wireshark

- Dissection of Tracee JSON events:
  
  - General event fields
  
  - Basic arguments (fields registered dynamically according to argument type)
  
  - Special arguments (complex data types):
    
    - String arrays
    
    - Process lineage
    
    - struct sockaddr*
    
    - slim_cred_t
    
    - trace.PktMeta
    
    - []trace.DnsQueryData
    
    - trace.ProtoHTTPRequest
  
  - Dissection of arguments in "triggered by" (for signatures)
  
  - Network related fields added as fields of the appropriate Wireshark native dissector for that protocol, so network events can now be filtered using native Wireshark filters.
  
  - Arguments listed in info column
  
  - Selected events override info column with a custom, concise messsage

- Dissection of packet captures generated by Tracee. This dissector adds Tracee context based on the interface description, a feature which is not yet part of Tracee.

  - Custom columns tailored for Tracee events
  
  - Custom coloring based on event types
  
  - Quick filter butttons for common event categories

  - Local live capture on Linux
  
  - Ability to specift command line options for Tracee
  
  - Preset system for saved Tracee command lines
